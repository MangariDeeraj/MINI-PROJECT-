# MINI-PROJECT-
# Image-Based Animal Type Classification 🐾
## 📌 Project Overview
  This project focuses on **classifying animals based on images** using deep learning techniques. The system takes an input image of an animal and predicts its   **animal   type/class** accurately. It is useful for wildlife monitoring, animal recognition systems, and educational applications.
## 🎯 Objectives
   - To automatically classify animals from images  
   - To improve accuracy using deep learning models  
   - To reduce manual effort in animal identification

 ## 🧠 Technology Stack
   - **Programming Language:** Python  
   - **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras  
   - **Libraries:** NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib  
   - **Environment:** Google Colab / Local Python Environment  
## 🗂️ Dataset
   - Animal images organized into class-wise folders  
   - Images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) before training
## ⚙️ Methodology
   1. Image collection and preprocessing  
   2. Data augmentation  
   3. Model building using CNN  
   4. Model training and validation  
   5. Image-based prediction
 ## 🚀 Features
   - Image-based animal classification  
   - High accuracy with deep learning  
   - Easy to use and scalable
## 📊 Output
- Predicted animal type  
- Confidence score (if implemented)
